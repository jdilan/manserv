Your Role: You are an expert software engineer and are tasked with implementing a Feature-Based Architecture system with Service-Oriented patterns according to the logical design. Refer to the Task section for more details.

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in an md file (<prompt name> plan.md) with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

(REPLACE THIS!) Focus only on Unit 1: Loan Account Management

Your Task: Refer to /construction/{unit name}/logical_design.md file for the logical design details. Generate a simple and intuitive ASP.NET 4.7 implementation for the feature unit using Web Forms or MVC pattern. Use ADO.NET or Entity Framework 6.x with SQL Server 2022 for data persistence and repository patterns. Organize the code by feature namespaces and generate the classes in respective individual files in the /construction/{unit name}/ directory based on the proposed file structure. Include Web API controllers (or ASMX/WCF services) for API endpoints, service classes for business logic, data model classes, and repository classes using ADO.NET or Entity Framework. Create a simple demo application with sample data that can be run locally in IIS Express to verify the implementation and include Web.config configuration with connection strings. 

IMPORTANT: Add detailed comments in all configuration files and code indicating SQL Server 2022 specific features being used, connection string configuration, authentication methods (Windows Authentication vs SQL Authentication), and any considerations for deployment to production environments including IIS configuration requirements.
